<div class="container">
    <p>During the late 20th and early 21st century, cars increased in weight due to batteries,[64] modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and "more-powerful—if more efficient—engines"[65] and, as of 2019, typically weigh between 1 and 3 tonnes (1.1 and 3.3 short tons; 0.98 and 2.95 long tons).[66] Heavier cars are safer for the driver from a crash perspective, but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users.[65] The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance, with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance. The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, a typical city car, weighs about 700 kilograms (1,500 lb). Heavier cars include SUVs and extended-length SUVs like the Suburban. Cars have also become wider.[67]

        Some places tax heavier cars more:[68] as well as improving pedestrian safety this can encourage manufacturers to use materials such as recycled aluminium instead of steel.[69] It has been suggested that one benefit of subsidizing charging infrastructure is that cars can use lighter batteries and Most cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats. Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. Utility vehicles like pickup trucks, combine seating with extra cargo or utility functionality. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, coupe, and minivan.</p>
